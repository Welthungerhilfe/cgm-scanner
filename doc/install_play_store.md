This can be a bit tricky because of the setup of the phones.
During setup the ICT specialist has to
- skip account recovery messages
- skip payment options
- install updates of all apps (automatic updates while charging should be already enabled)

A complete walkthrough with screenshots follows at the end of this document.

# Handling of phones

- Before using the app you should check if you are logged in with your account (email address)
- In the evening you should connect the phone to the charger and make sure it has a wifi connection
